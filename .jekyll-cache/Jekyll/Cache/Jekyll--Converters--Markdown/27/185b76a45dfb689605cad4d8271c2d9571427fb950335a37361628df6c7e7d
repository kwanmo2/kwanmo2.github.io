<p>This page does not have a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">title</code>, and it is excluded from the navigation â€“ unless it is located in a Jekyll collection (which provides default titles). To exclude a title-less page from the navigation, regardless of whether it is located in a collection, set <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nav_exclude: true</code>.</p>
