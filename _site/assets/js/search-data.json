You can reuse the same parameter values (e.g., integers starting from 1) for the child pages of different parents. The parameter values can be numbers (integers, floats) and/or strings. When you omit nav_order parameters, they default to the titles of the pages, which are ordered alphabetically. Pages with numerical nav_order parameters always come before those with strings or default nav_order parameters. If you want to make the page order independent of the page titles, you can set explicit nav_order parameters on all pages. By default, all Capital letters come before all lowercase letters; you can add nav_sort: case_insensitive in the configuration file to ignore the case. Enclosing strings in quotation marks is optional. Note for users of previous versions: nav_sort: case_insensitive previously affected the ordering of numerical nav_order parameters: e.g., 10 came before 2. Also, all pages with explicit nav_order parameters previously came before all pages with default parameters. Both were potentially confusing, and they have now been eliminated. ",

    "content": "Sometimes you will want to create a page with many children (a section). First, it is recommended that you keep pages that are related in a directory together… For example, in these docs, we keep all of the written documentation in the ./docs directory and each of the sections in subdirectories like ./docs/ui-components and ./docs/utilities. This gives us an organization like: . +-- .. |-- (Jekyll files) |-- docs |-- ui-components | |-- index.md (parent page) | |-- buttons.md | |-- code.md | |-- labels.md | |-- tables.md | +-- typography.md | |-- utilities | |-- index.md (parent page) | |-- color.md | |-- layout.md | |-- responsive-modifiers.md | +-- typography.md | |-- (other md files, pages with no children) | +-- .. |-- (Jekyll files) +-- .. On the parent pages, add this YAML front matter parameter: . | has_children: true (tells us that this is a parent page) | . Example . --- layout: default title: UI Components nav_order: 2 has_children: true --- . Here we’re setting up the UI Components landing page that is available at /docs/ui-components, which has children and is ordered second in the main nav. Child pages . On child pages, simply set the parent: YAML front matter to whatever the parent’s page title is and set a nav order (this number is now scoped within the section). Example . --- layout: default title: Buttons parent: UI Components nav_order: 2 --- . The Buttons page appears as a child of UI Components and appears second in the UI Components section. Auto-generating Table of Contents . By default, all pages with children will automatically append a Table of Contents which lists the child pages after the parent page’s content. To disable this auto Table of Contents, set has_toc: false in the parent page’s YAML front matter. Example . --- layout: default title: UI Components nav_order: 2 has_children: true has_toc: false --- . Children with children . Child pages can also have children (grandchildren). This is achieved by using a similar pattern on the child and grandchild pages. | Add the has_children attribute to the child | Add the parent and grand_parent attribute to the grandchild | . Example . --- layout: default title: Buttons parent: UI Components nav_order: 2 has_children: true --- . --- layout: default title: Buttons Child Page parent: Buttons grand_parent: UI Components nav_order: 1 --- .
